## Findings from univariate plots



There are only 3 lengths of loan terms. Most are for 36 months, fewer have a duration of 60, and a small number were payed off in 12 months.

The majority of loans are current or completed. More loans were cancelled than defaulted, and thereâ€™s a slight decrease in past due loans as time goes on.
